## Differences with the original
To decrease difficulty, we didnt apply some concepts like the left passage putnuation, that decreased it's rewards every 20 seconds.
Some other interactions are missing, like planet travelling after collecting fuel, so we added a ponts reward. 
There is no bonus and jackpot score in our game.
Few sounds are missing or different from the original game
